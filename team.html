    <h1>Team</h1>
    <h2>Organisation</h2>
    <p>The project's tasks were delegated to two teams, a software and hardware team. Each team had its own team leader in charge of team progress. A technical advisor helped bridge the team's development when tasks were dependent on another. The project had a project manager to help organize the team. Teams had weekly meetings in conjunction with a general project meeting.</p>
    <p>Tasks were delegated and organized on Notion where deadlines were shown. To discuss the project and tasks the team used Slack channels organized into different teams or purposes such as general, software, and hardware. For sharing of code, a GitHub repository was created to allow for version control and access for all members of the team.</p>
    <p>The structure, ethic and building process of small iterative bursts can be compared to an Agile Methodology. The team follows an "Agile" environment where tasks with the highest priority are focused on at any one point. This model was very successful as it has created a lot of transparency through teams achieving good integration with respect to the progress of the project.</p>
