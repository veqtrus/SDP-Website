    <h1>System</h1>
    <h2>Our Product</h2>
    <p>SousChef is the first fully automatic vegetable cutter designed with the needs of people with physical disabilities in mind. Cutting vegetables is a time-consuming and often dull process for most. But, despite its lacklustre appeal, cutting is a fine motor skill that for some can be difficult if not impossible. Various disability groups such as people with Parkinson's disease, people with physical impairments or even the blind may have a hard time performing this crucial kitchen task. Our product aims to make cooking accessible to all, through simplifying the cutting process to just placing a vegetable on the cutting board of SousChef. Through the use of a sleek and simple UI or easy to learn voice commands our users can specify exactly how they want their vegetable cut. Sous Chef gets to work and within minutes it presents the user with a finely cut vegetable, ready for cooking.</p>
    <h2>Fuctionality</h2>
    <p>SousChef’s ease of use is thanks to the seamless and innovative integration of different technologies. SousChef can be operated through a simple UI that was designed based on [...studies on usability]. To operate the cutter you just follow a very intuitive and straightforward process to specify the cuts you want, on the inbuilt touchscreen. For those who are unable to operate a touchscreen due to a motor disease, blindness or any other disability, SousChef can also be operated through voice commands. SousChef wakes to the simple phrase “Hey Chef”. All you have to do after that is specify the number of slices or pieces. The system also provides audio feedback upon recognising a command so that the user can rest assured that they have interacted with SousChef successfully.</p>
    <p>As with any kitchen appliance, safety is an integral concern in the design process. For this reason, SousChef’s inner workings all live inside a surrounding case. The case easily opens from the front to allow for ease of access of the cutting board. To operate, open the case’s front door, place the vegetable on the board, shut the door and operation should begin immediately. If the door remains open, SousChef will remain idle until it is shut. This way, the entire cutting process remains inaccessible to the user, ensuring safety in the kitchen. In addition, the integrated computer vision automatically detects whether the placed item is indeed a vegetable. In the case that it is not, the cut will simply not be performed to avoid any damage to the blade and potential dangerous malfunctioning of the cutter. During the cutting process, the user can also vocally tell SousChef to 'stop' resulting in the process ending.</p>
    <p>Our modular design makes SousChef very easy to clean. The cutting board is both easy to access and fully removable, making it ideal for cleaning. The protective casing of SousChef is also removable allowing the user to access the inner workings of the product for internal cleaning. Of course, removing the casing means that SousChef cannot operate so that our users feel safe when accessing it. The blade used to cut the vegetables can also be easily removed for cleaning or replacing.</p>
